Feature: WebSocket Connection Testing

  Scenario: Establish WebSocket Connection
    Given the WebSocket endpoint is "ws://localhost:8080/websocket/some/path"
    When the client establishes a WebSocket connection
    Then the WebSocket connection should be established successfully

  Scenario: WebSocket Circuit Breaker
    Given the WebSocket endpoint is "ws://localhost:8080/websocket/some/path"
    When the client triggers a WebSocket circuit breaker event
    Then the WebSocket circuit breaker should transition to the open state

  Scenario: Rate Limiter
    Given the WebSocket endpoint is "ws://localhost:8080/websocket/some/path"
    When the client sends more than 100 requests in a minute
    Then the WebSocket server should limit the requests

  Scenario: WebSocket Event Handling
    Given the WebSocket endpoint is "ws://localhost:8080/websocket/some/path"
    When the client establishes a WebSocket connection
    And the client closes the WebSocket connection
    Then the WebSocket server should handle onConnect and onClose events

  Scenario: WebSocket Message Exchange
    Given the WebSocket endpoint is "ws://localhost:8080/websocket/some/path"
    When the client establishes a WebSocket connection
    And the client sends a message "Hello, WebSocket!"
    Then the WebSocket server should receive the message and respond
